%TODO: Abstract
As virtual reality increasingly finds more use cases, methods of improving the experience beyond graphical fidelity have to be investigated. One such improvement is giving the user a full virtual body, to make him feel part of the virtual world. Problems, however, are created when the user tries to interact with the virtual world with his virtual body, but but without the interaction having any effect on his real body. There has been research into preventing, or encouraging the user to resolve, situations in which his real and virtual body are not in sync, but the focus has largely been on the head and hands. Recently, hardware has become widely available that also allows tracking of any other object, such as the user's feet.
\newline
In this thesis, techniques of alerting the user to, and encouraging him to resolve, such discrepancies between his real and virtual body will be investigated, and implemented in the \textit{Neurorobotics Unity3D Client}, with a focus on the feet.
